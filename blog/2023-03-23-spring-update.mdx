To kick it off, v11.5.0 was released! 🎉 It comes with Auto pan, snappy connections, error handling, the NodeResizer component, and more goodies that I won’t get into here, because there’s already a [write-up about the release](https://reactflow.dev/blog/react-flow-v-11-5/) by Moritz.

<!--truncate-->

v.11.6.0 was released too! 🎊🎊 This one came with:

- isValidConnection prop for the ReactFlow component (no need to pass it to every Handle)
- nodeComponent prop for the MiniMap ([thanks Hayleigh](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow/pull/2906)!)
- An option to specify if updateEdge should replace the edge id or create a new one ([thanks Braks](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow/pull/2847)!)

- John explains React Flow in a 60 second video, so we can finally tell our parents what we do at work. This is a part of our improvements to the [Quickstart page](https://reactflow.dev/docs/quickstart/) in our docs
- [Make your own mindmap app](https://reactflow.dev/blog/mind-map-app-with-react-flow/) with React Flow in this step-by-step guide by Moritz
- Codesandbox shortcuts! Use [new.reactflow.dev/react-js](https://new.reactflow.dev/react-js) or [new.reactflow.dev/react-ts](https://new.reactflow.dev/react-js) to create a brand new
- New Pro examples: [Undo / Redo](https://reactflow.dev/docs/examples/interaction/undo-and-redo/), and [Helper Lines](https://reactflow.dev/docs/examples/interaction/helper-lines/) (we love this one), as well as a total refresh of [Expand / Collapse](https://reactflow.dev/docs/examples/layout/expand-collapse/)
- [We wrote an article about money in the open source world](https://reactflow.dev/blog/asking-for-money-for-open-source/), and how we make ours. It got featured on Javascript Weekly and React Status!
- In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we now have a [React Flow Code of Conduct](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Say hello to Hayleigh 👋🏻

She’s the newest member of the React Flow team! She's an enthusiast of Gleam, Elm, and her two cats Ada and Haskell. You’ve probably already seen her around the discord server, github, and everywhere else really. We’re super happy to have her with us!

## Around the community

- Liveblocks made this slick [Collaborative Flowchart example](https://liveblocks.io/examples/collaborative-flowchart/zustand) using React Flow (and we got almost 100 new twitter followers from a single tweet about this 😄)
- React Flow 💕 Nhost. [Here’s why](https://nhost.io/customers/react-flow).
- We did some work with the team at [Patterns](https://www.patterns.app/) last year and they successfully launched last month- congrats!! 🚀

## What's next?

We’ve been exploring how we can generalize the core of React Flow, so that it could be adapted more easily to other frameworks. If "Svelte Flow" sounds interesting to you, [send us an email](mailto:info@reactflow.dev), we'd love to talk 👀

We got a paid subscription from an organization who we don't want to support because they violate [basic human rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights). We’ve already denied service and refunded them, and we're working on adjusting our terms of service using [https://firstdonoharm.dev/](https://firstdonoharm.dev/) as a template to prevent this from happening again.

## News from Berlin

We were just at [FOSS Backstage Berlin](https://23.foss-backstage.de/) last week. We learned about OSPOs, open roadmaps, restorative justice in open source communities, and more. We think we’ll be back again next year!

We’ve moved! Same address, same floor, just 10 meters further away from the kitchen, in a slightly more comfortable room, with the same banging noise for an hour each morning as the previous room. Feels like home.

That’s all for now! Thanks for being here ✌🏻
