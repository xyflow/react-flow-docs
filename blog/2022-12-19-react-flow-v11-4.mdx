Hey! We wanted to share an update about what we’ve been up to before we wrap ourselves up in blankets to hibernate until the new year (we’ll be shutting our laptops from today until January 2nd ⛄). Let’s get into what’s been up the past few months, what’s coming, and what we’re excited about right now.

## Pan, zoom, and select like your favorite design tools with the v11.4.0 minor release 💫

In the [latest minor release](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow/releases/tag/11.4.0), you can finally configure the controls so that they behave like Figma, Miro or Sketch. This includes click-dragging to make a selection, [pan by holding the spacebar, and scrolling to zoom](https://reactflow.dev/docs/guides/panning-and-zooming/). You can also configure if a node is selected if it is fully inside/partially inside the selection area.

## Supporting beyond nodes and edges with helper components

As we’ve done research on apps that use React Flow, we’ve noticed a lot of folks are custom-building a lot of similar elements (or using third-party libraries) on top of React Flow. To help with this, we’ve started to build helper components including [Edge labels](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/edges/edge-label-renderer/), [node resizing](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/nodes/node-resizer/), [toolbars and tooltips](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/nodes/node-toolbar/). We’re doing this work carefully, to make sure we’re not compromising the low-level simplicity of the core library, while making sure React Flow includes all components that are needed for building a node-based app.

We hope to continue on this path, this will mean talking to some of you all (yay research!) about the apps you’re building with React Flow, and how we can support you in building them.

## More new examples!

**[Intersections](https://reactflow.dev/docs/examples/nodes/intersections/)**: This example uses the new [intersection helpers](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/react-flow-instance/#isnodeintersecting) to detect if a node intersects with another node.

**[Resize and Rotate](https://reactflow.dev/docs/examples/nodes/resize-rotate/):** This was a Pro example, but we decided to make the source code available to everyone in our public docs to avoid trouble people were having with third-party resizing libraries.

**[Dynamic Grouping](https://reactflow.dev/docs/examples/nodes/dynamic-grouping/)** (Pro Example 💎): Grouping nodes made easy! Make new groups or add a node to an existing group by dragging a node from a drawer or using a “group nodes” button.

## In other news: npm blunder, a growing list of UIs, a lightning talk

**We shared our mistakes** of [how we lost our slick new npm package name (and then got it back)](https://reactflow.dev/blog/reactflow-npm-package-name/).

**A lot of people liked our list of [Awesome Node Based UIs](https://github.com/wbkd/awesome-node-based-uis)** with resources, libraries, and good-looking apps. Within a month of publishing it we already have more than 120 entries, 22 contributors and 1k Github stars!! So cool. And this [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33641786) on Hackernews was too good not to share 😊

**We met people IRL** at React Day Berlin and gave a lightning talk on making React Flow financially sustainable. We’re interested in giving more talks (maybe at [re:publica 23](https://re-publica.com/en)?) and finding our community as a company, and this was one step towards that for us. The talk isn’t publicly available yet, but it will be soon [here](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/making-an-open-source-library-financially-sustainable).

Cheers and have a cozy winter holiday! See you in 2023.
