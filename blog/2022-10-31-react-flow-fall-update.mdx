## Hey there!

Here’s a dispatch straight from our desks about what’s happened in the last couple of months at React Flow: updates, news, and a peek behind-the-scenes. Here we go.

<!--truncate-->

### Some v11 post-launch housekeeping

React Flow v11 went live in early October (woohoo! 🎉), and Moritz wrote a [whole blog post](https://reactflow.dev/blog/react-flow-v11/) all about it if you haven't seen yet.

Post-launch, we took a few weeks to tend to our current structures. We made some fixes to accessibility updates from v11 (thanks to some wonderful user feedback 💕), added the new props `nodesFocusable` and `edgesFocusable` to make the keyboard handling better configurable , and took some time to refocus ourselves for the end of the year.

(Shout-out to Supabase for the inspiration on [post-release weeks](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/releases/tag/0.22.09).)

### Examples, examples, examples

We’ve added a bunch of new examples to the docs like [Collision Detection](https://reactflow.dev/docs/examples/interaction/collision-detection/), [Easy Connect](https://reactflow.dev/docs/examples/nodes/easy-connect/), [Download Image](https://reactflow.dev/docs/examples/misc/download-image/), [Tailwind Implementation](https://reactflow.dev/docs/examples/styling/tailwind/), and [Light / Dark Mode](https://reactflow.dev/docs/examples/styling/styled-components/). (For Pro subscribers, we added the [Workflow Builder](https://pro.reactflow.dev/examples/workflow-builder), aka the “taco flow.”)

### Our first round of user research

We talked to some folks who are subscribed to [React Flow Pro](https://pro.reactflow.dev/), and learned a lot about their expectations and needs from us. It was great to talk to people using React Flow on a daily basis in ways we didn’t imagine before. We’ll be doing ongoing user research with people like yourself! If you’re up for helping us with that, keep your eyes on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/RVmnytFmGW), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/reactflowdev), or sign up for our Newsletter.

We’ll be sharing out some of those findings from our research at our lightning talk at React Day Berlin in December - if you’re coming, let us know and let’s say hi 👋🏻

### Explaining ourselves better

<Image img="/img/blog/fall-2022/handles-definition.png" />

We also **added some basic explainers to the docs** (answering questions like [“what is a handle?”](https://reactflow.dev/docs/overview/terms-and-definitions/#handles)) to encourage easier onboarding for folks who are new to React Flow.

We also changed our docs to make it clear that **anyone is allowed to remove the attribution** (even without a subscription). React Flow is under an [MIT License](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow/blob/main/LICENSE), so you can do anything you want with the code.

### In the office

**Over at our office** in Kreuzberg, Berlin, we put up a whiteboard, ordered some embroidered hats, had a 4-legged visitor, and continue to be entertained by the ongoing construction site across the s

### What's next?

As we move into the winter, we’re thinking about how we want to wrap up this year, and what 2023 will bring. Some of the big questions we’re asking ourselves these days are:

- How might we help devs to improve the UX of their flows? (maybe themes, guides about styling, or sharing more custom styles?)
- Giving more opportunity for feedback and discussion with the React Flow community
- Show and tell more openly about what we do and how we do it at React Flow

And finally, Moritz made this _handy_ custom node.

Happy coding and see you around!
