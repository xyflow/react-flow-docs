This example shows how to build a collaborative graph for multiple users with React Flow and [yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs). The changes made in this graph are visible for all users on this page. To see it working, you can [open this page in another tab](https://reactflow.dev/docs/examples/interaction/collaborative/) or on another device or browser.
The example can be used as a starting point to build multi user flows and editors.

Dependencies: [react-flow-renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-flow-renderer), [yjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yjs)
