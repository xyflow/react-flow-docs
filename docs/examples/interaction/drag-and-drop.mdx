A drag and drop user interface is very common for node-based workflow editors. The drag and drop behaviour outside of the React Flow pane is not built in but can be implemented with the native [HTML Drag and Drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) (used in this example) or a third party library like [react-draggable](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-draggable).
