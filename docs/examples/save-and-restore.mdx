If you want to save and restore a flow you can use the `toObject` function of the React Flow instance.
In this example you can move nodes around, add ones and save the flow. Then reload the page and click restore to restore your flow.

<CodeViewer codePath="example-flows/SaveRestore" additionalFiles={['index.css']} />
