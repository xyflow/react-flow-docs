import CodeViewer from '/src/components/CodeViewer';
const dependencies = { dagre: 'latest' };
const files = ['nodes-edges.js', 'index.css'];

This example shows how you can integrate [dagre.js](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre) with React Flow to create simple tree layouts. Good alternatives to dagre are [d3-hierarchy](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy) or [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) if you are looking for a more advanced layouting library.
