A diagram can go from left to right or from top to bottom, but you can also create mixed ones.
For controlling the direction of a diagram you can adjust the handle positions of a node with the [`sourcePosition` and `targetPosition`](/docs/api/nodes/node-options/#options) props.

<CodeViewer codePath="example-flows/Horizontal" />
