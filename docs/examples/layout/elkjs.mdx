import CodeViewer from '/src/components/CodeViewer';
const dependencies = { elkjs: 'latest' };
const files = ['nodes-edges.js'];

Like our [dagre example](/docs/examples/layout/dagre), this example shows how you can integrate [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) with React Flow for more advanced tree layouts. The code for this example builds a similar tree to the dagre example, but you can look at the reference [here](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/reference.html) to see what you can configure (hint: it's a lot).
