React Flow is a library for building node-based applications. These can be simple static diagrams or complex editors. You can implement custom node types and edge types and it comes with components like a mini-map and graph controls. The best way to start is to follow the [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/installation) or check out the [examples](https://reactflow.dev/examples).

## Key Features

- **Easy to use:** Seamless zooming & panning behaviour and single and multi-selections of nodes and edges
- **Customizable:** Different [node](/docs/api/nodes/node-types) and [edge types](/docs/api/edges/edge-types) and support for custom nodes with multiple handles and custom edges
- **Fast rendering:** Only nodes that have changed are re-rendered and only those that are in the viewport are displayed
- **Hooks and Utils:** [Hooks](/docs/api/hooks/use-react-flow) for handling nodes, edges and the viewport and [graph util functions](/docs/api/graph-util-functions)
- **Plugin Components:** [Background](/docs/api/plugin-components/background), [MiniMap](/docs/api/plugin-components/minimap) and [Controls](/docs/api/plugin-components/controls)
- **Reliable**: Written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and tested with [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

## Pro Subscription

We are working full time on React Flow and related projects. If you are using React Flow commercially, please consider to do a monthly [pro subscription](https://pro.reactflow.dev) or a [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/wbkd). With the pro subscription you are allowed to remove the "React Flow" attribution and you can get support through our private discord channel. And most importantly, you secure further development of the library.
